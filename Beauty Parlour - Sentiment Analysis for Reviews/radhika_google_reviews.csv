ND,One of the worst parlour . Lot of negativity . They are in the locality for many years hence they do not care for their customers. They do not listen to the customers needs . Just work based on their experience and non stop talking even while working  . And congested place .

Sumathi R,"I am there customer since 12 years. The service they provide is extra ordinary, products used are very good quality, they are very generous and kind. Best customer experience and very professional. They give a lot of beauty tips on maintaining your skin. All though more you will feel very homely and friendly atmosphere."
